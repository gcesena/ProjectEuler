 * Because the very last solution, as given in the overview paper, is very specific: not only for the radix it can be
 * used in (only 10), but also for the number of digits of the factors it can be run with (again, only 3).
 *
 * Any implementation would be parameter-less, accompanied by a single trivial test and programmatically non interesting
